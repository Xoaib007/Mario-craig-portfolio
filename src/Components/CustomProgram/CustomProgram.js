                <p>Throughout my fitness journey, I’ve helped hundreds of people to improve their relationship with food and their bodies. But more than that, they've extended their lives and put the spark back into their training. While variety is essential to keep you interested - too much variety might inhibit your progress. That's why, as a personal trainer in Fareham, I want to help you stick with a training programme long enough that you see real results.</p>
